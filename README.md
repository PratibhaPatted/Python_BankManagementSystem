# Python_BankManagementSystem

## Introduction

This system is primarily intended for the storage of banking information. The C programming language was used to create the entire system. It establishes a basic notion of how clients' bank details, such as their name, address, phone number, and other information, are preserved. The user interface is straightforward, with a standard screen design, so staff may quickly become accustomed to it.
